          <h2>Chameleon</h2>
          <h3>This essay was written for ENES 3100 "Engineering, Ethics & Society Seminar". The essay focuses on the character of Queen Gertrude in Shakespeare's Hamlet, and it explores political power struggles and what it means to be a bystander in conflict through her.</h3>
          <p>
            Is change always good, or does it only benefit the singular party instigating that change? The world of Hamlet is full of people whose lives are drastically altered by the battle raging between Hamlet and Claudius, and the transformations brought onto Denmark by their conflict often turned innocent and guilty bystanders alike into victims. One such victim was Queen Gertrude, whose motivations and background were largely hidden by Shakespeare. The mystery of her character sparks many questions about her old relationship with King Hamlet and her new marriage with Claudius. Was she unfaithful to King Hamlet prior to his death? Was King Hamlet unfaithful to her? Why did she remarry so quickly, and why did she not inherit King Hamlet’s power? Shakespeare does not provide a lot of direct evidence that can be used to find definitive answers, but one reasonable assumption that can be made is that Queen Gertrude had an awareness of the delicate situation that she shared with so many others following King Hamlet’s death, and she realized that it was not enough to claim neutrality - she had to actively align herself with both friends and foes to survive. Like a chameleon being forced to alternate between colors as camouflage, Gertrude enabled the continuation of Hamlet’s and Claudius’ conflict as she switched back and forth between sides. Gertrude willingly sacrificed most of her autonomy in favor of maintaining status and safety, and thus she tied her fate to the struggles of those around her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gertrude’s history before the events of Hamlet is mysterious and largely unknown, but its ambiguity and her position at the start of the play suggest her willingness to ‘evolve’. We first learn about Gertrude’s background through Hamlet’s soliloquies, where he claims that his father, King Hamlet, was “so loving to [his] mother / That he might not beteem the winds of heaven / Visit her face too roughly.” (Shakespeare 1.2.144-46). Yet to the confusion of Hamlet, it is revealed that it had not even been two months following King Hamlet’s death that Queen Gertrude had remarried, and to King Hamlet’s brother Claudius of all people. It is mentioned that Gertrude is an “imperial jointress”, meaning she had the legal rights to inherit King Hamlet’s power over Denmark following his death (Shakespeare 1.2.9). However, this path was never realized in Hamlet. Gertrude likely recognized the weakness of her position as a widowed queen, and so she sought stability in a new marriage. The reasoning behind why she did not take power herself was revealed while Gertrude was condemning Hamlet’s somber attitude, where she speaks in a rather philosophical way about her husband’s death:
          </p>
          <p>
            QUEEN. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,<br>
            And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.<br>
            Do not forever with thy vailèd lids<br>
            Seek for thy father in the dust.<br>
            Thou know’st ‘tis common; all that lives must die,<br>
            Passing through nature to eternity. (Shakespeare 1.2.70-75)<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            In this moment, Gertrude reveals her rejection of grief through an acceptance of mortality. The death of King Hamlet was as inevitable as the death of any other person, but the suddenness of his death destabilized power in such a way that Gertrude was forced to act quickly. It was easier for Gertrude to attach her power to Claudius rather than claim leadership and run the risk of making enemies like her deceased husband had, for that was more likely to endanger her status and her life. Even though her new marriage could present risks to her power in the same way her old marriage could have, Gertrude lacked the time to wait for her son to return from abroad and claim the throne, and thus she made a reactionary decision that forced her into a corner.
          </p>
          <p>
            In safekeeping her power, Gertrude intentionally lost her ability to carve out her own values and ideas, as she became merely a pawn echoing the voices of those she relied on. Following Claudius’ sudden departure from The Murder of Gonzago, Gertrude proclaims to Hamlet that “thou hast thy father much offended” (Shakespeare 3.4.12). In normal family dynamics, such a comment would be typical, but it takes on extra meaning knowing that Gertrude has closely aligned herself with Claudius in ways beyond marriage. Any attack on Claudius is an attack on her, and so she must come to his defense to save herself. Following Hamlet’s murder of Polonius and his scathing attack against his mother’s unfaithfulness to King Hamlet, Gertrude asks him, “What have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue / In noise so rude against me?”, suggesting that Gertrude has forgotten how her ‘unfaithfulness’ to King Hamlet was fracturing her relationship to Hamlet (Shakespeare 3.4.47-48). For a brief moment, Gertrude seems to forget how dangerous Hamlet is as she tries to assert her maternal authority over him. She shows some compassion for Hamlet by trying to figure out what could be upsetting him, but as the scene continues, this strategy devolves into the Queen repeatedly asking Hamlet to stop insulting her, until finally she asks him, “What shall I do?” (Shakespeare 3.4.202). This moment is critical for Gertrude, as she is forced into the center of the conflict between Claudius and Hamlet. While she needs to be loyal to Claudius to maintain her status, Hamlet’s apparent insanity and now-revealed taste for violence has jeopardized her safety, and no power that she or Claudius has can save her in that instant. By asking for guidance from Hamlet, she temporarily aligns herself with him to protect herself. Gertrude appears to backtrack on this new relationship with her son in the next scene when she reveals to Claudius the murder that Hamlet committed. Interestingly enough, she does not reveal anything else about what Hamlet knows in regards to Claudius’ intentions for him. By playing both sides, she is attempting to maximize her chances of surviving the rivalry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Queen Gertrude is consistently selfish throughout the play, as she shifts her loyalties around to keep herself from losing her power at the hands of the enemies of her allies. Her familial values take a backseat to her need for stability, while her disregard for death highlights her awareness of how instability brings unwanted change, and if she doesn’t adapt to that change, she could suffer the consequences. Gertrude was mistaken, however, in believing that it was possible to appease Hamlet and Claudius simultaneously. Her final moments, where she drank against Claudius’ wishes from the cup poisoned by him, showed how by regaining her autonomy, she unknowingly rejected the safety of Claudius’ power, and so she became a victim of the conflict like so many others. Gertrude unnecessarily put herself into the center of the rivalry when she initially took Claudius’ side and put herself more at risk than if she had stayed neutral. If Gertrude had not alienated herself from others by corrupting her familial relationships and her loyalties, she might have survived, and at the very least, not had to sacrifice her own image in death. The horrible fates of Gertrude and others in Hamlet suggest that there is no ideal way to avoid such grand conflicts, and the only person, if anyone, whose life and character remains unchanged by its conclusion is the victor.

          <h2>New Student & Family Programs Scholarship for Continuing Students Essay</h2>
          <h3>This essay was awarded the 2021 New Student & Family Programs Scholarship. The original prompt is as follows: In 500-650 words, please share some advice you would provide to a student who was planning to attend to CU Boulder on how to be most successful in their transition to CU. Please recommend ways they can make this new campus feel like their home. </h3>
          <p>
          Going to college in a new city, a new state, or a new country can be very daunting, but CU Boulder can truly be a home away from home for everyone. One of the greatest hallmarks of CU Boulder is its commitment to provide opportunities and resources to give students space to be themselves. Becoming a part of the CU community is as much about better understanding yourself as it is about embodying what it means to be a Buff. It is okay to feel overwhelmed at first, but the best way to make a successful transition to life on campus and to starting your journey as a Buff is to accept that discomfort and pursue it further.
          </p>
          <p>
          Part of making campus feel like a home is figuring out where you fit into the Boulder community. One of the best outcomes of college is not necessarily earning a degree, but reaching a greater understanding of who you are, what has made you the person you are today, and what parts of your identity are truly yours to claim, through introspection. College can teach relevant skills and knowledge, but what it is usually not given credit for is its ability to reteach students how to learn and how to reevaluate their own identity. So often are students asked to share what they believe their purpose is, but CU can truly be a place where students have the time and resources to reflect and give an authentic answer. So it’s important to take each aspect of one’s self, including what you feel you are and aren’t passionate about, and take steps towards determining if those passions define you. CU will be able to be as homely as it can be when you’re able to be authentically yourself.
          </p> 
          <p>
          Reaching out to people with similar classes, majors, or interests can help to create a sense of belonging around what traits you perceive to be key to defining yourself. You might find that by attending office hours, you will find that a professor is knowledgeable in an area of research that fascinates you, or you might find that another student attending a dorm social event has a similar taste in movies and music. Ultimately, finding people who share your interests and passions is key to not only being able to turn CU Boulder into a place where your experience is an active choice made by you, but also to creating a sense of togetherness by bonding with others with similar perspectives and experiences. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Of course, going outside of your comfort zone is just as important. It ultimately does not matter whether or not you enjoy new activities or experiences, because simply doing new things helps you to examine yourself and your passions from an external perspective. You could try joining one of CU Boulder’s many extracurricular clubs, intramural sports teams, or volunteer groups, even if they aren’t directly related to your major or background, and in doing so you may come to realize that your passions may stem from core values you may have been unaware, like for example, having a competitive spirit or a desire to help others. Better understanding yourself can help you to better tailor your experience at CU Boulder to your core values, which can open the door to opportunities you would not have previously considered.
          </p>
          <p>
          Attending CU Boulder for the first time might feel like a scary experience because you’re meeting new people and exploring new places for the first time, but it’s important to remember that everyone else is as well. Making the effort to reach out to a fellow floormate or classmate, even if it’s for something as simple as getting food or playing board games together, can make a huge difference in helping each other to transition while making a positive contribution to the overall Boulder community.
