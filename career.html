          <h2> GLEE - Colorado Space Grant Consortium </h2>
          <p>
            The Colorado Space Grant Consortium is a NASA-funded organization that provides college students with opportunities to work on space-related projects. GLEE, the Great Lunar Expedition for Everyone, is a student project at CU Boulder funded through Artemis Student Challenges. Its mission is two-fold: to engage student teams around the world with lunar science through the programming and usage of custom, Arduino-based PCBs known as LunaSats, and to perform distributed science on the surface of the Moon with the LunaSats programmed by these student teams. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on this project from March 2021 to August 2023 as a member, advisor, and lead of the Software subteam. I have developed C++ code through the Arduino platform to support the functionality of the LunaSat sensor suite, as well as for the educational workshop modules directed at teaching student teams about using the LunaSats for lunar science, many of which focus on specific LunaSat sensors through guided activities that use Arduino sketches. In support of GLEE and the workshop, the team created a series of Python Jupyter notebooks called the LunaSat Power and Data Model, which enabled the generation of over 15000 unique sensor configurations in addition to modeling their power and data usage as a way of verifying that they met mission constraints.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Software subteam lead, I implemented a test-driven development approach to the team's goals and defined a series of components that will make up the entirety of the final flight code for the LunaSats, including scripts for storing data, transmitting data, synchronizing clocks, etc.

          <h2> RandomX - Ricoh, USA </h2>
          <p> From May to August of 2022, I worked as a JavaScript Developer Intern on the Test Automation tema at Ricoh in Boulder, Colorado. My summer project was an extension to an already existing tool called TestBuilder, a drag-and-drop interface that allows testers to easily create automated tests for virtual versions of Ricoh's printer products. The extension, dubbed "RandomX", is a Monte Carlo test generator that randomly selects test steps with input from a user to create hundreds of automated tests. Not only would this reduce the time spent generating tests, but it would also serve as a gateway for future analytics to be performed, as the user can specify certain algorithms and weight models to guide the randomization towards areas representing possible risks or functional changes. </p>
